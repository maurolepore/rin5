Researchers embrace continuous learning, but they can't waste time with unfocused learning. The goal of rin5 (r in 5) is to help busy researchers to discover useful tools in R and GitHub. rin5 packages multiple video tutorials, each shorter than 5 minutes, along with supporting files. The videos are available in YouTube; they follow and cover the entire workflow of a typical research project. The supporting files help users get what the videos show. 

Most importantly, the tutorials demonstrate tools to: 

- manage and track research organizations, teams and projects using GitHub,

- communicate ideas and results using R Markdown and knitr,

- import, tidy, transform, visualize and model data easily using R Studio and tidyverse.

The tutorials are incompleate by design. They cover many topics quickly and provide links to learn more. How can you discover better ways of doing research if you never know those ways exist?

rin5 is not available from CRAN but  you can install it from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maurolepore/rin5")
```

### Read before you get too excited:

**Feb 21: Now rin5 package is almost empty, so the description you just read is aspirational. rin5 is accummulating [issues](https://github.com/maurolepore/rin5/issues) and if I find support, I will develop it.**
